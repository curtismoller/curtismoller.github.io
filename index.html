<h3>4. <span class="indent">Content Filters</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">

<div>4.1.</div>
<div class="indent"> Any pre-installed Content filters, such as e.g. “kids’ mode” or other similar
filter functions
that may be offered from time to time, are offered to a user as an optional function. The
metadata for each title in the Content that Storytel relies on regarding e.g. age limits and
identification of literary genres is provided by Storytel’s publishing business partners.
Storytel therefore takes no responsibility for, and does not warrant that, You will find the
filters based on such metadata completely to Your personal satisfaction. Furthermore,
Storytel can not in any way guarantee that such filters are completely accurate or that they
with complete certainty have filtered all non-relevant Content in accordance with what has
been intended. If a filter does not work to Your satisfaction, please discontinue any use of
the filter immediately and let us know how we may improve the filter and the Service to
better meet Your expectations by contacting Storytel via the Storytel website. Storytel
welcomes any feedback regarding Content that You find inappropriate or unsuitable in light
of the filters used or that you otherwise suspect may contain infringing or otherwise
unlawful features. Storytel depends on Your feedback so that we may improve our filters
and our Service over time.
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>4.2.</div>
<div class="indent"> If and where a pre-installed “kids’ mode” filter is offered to You as a Subscriber
of the
Service, the settings of such filter have been made based on the metadata to allow only
such Content that is deemed by its publisher as suitable for children aged twelve (12) years
old or younger. This means that the Content made available in "Kids’ mode" may include
any and all books and genres in the Storytel content catalogue intended for kids of all ages
within this age group. Storytel can not in any way guarantee that the filter is completely
accurate or that it with complete certainty have filtered all non-relevant Content in
accordance with what has been intended.

Gift Card when You are already a subscriber of the Service, Storytel will temporarily
suspend the requirement for payment of the Service until the expiry of the Gift Card, upon
which time You will be automatically transferred back as a paying customer of the Service
and resume the monthly subscription payment plan. If, in such case, the Gift Card You
activated regarded a different subscription plan than the one You were originally
subscribing to, You will automatically be transferred back to your most previously used
subscription plan. However, if such subscription plan is based on a product specific gift card
you will be automatically transferred back to your most previously used recurring
subscription plan based on a payment method not using a Gift Card.

times if required by law or in order to establish, exercise or defend a right in a legal
claim.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>5.8.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Storytel will cease to retain personal data, or remove the means by which
the data can be associated with You, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that retention no
longer serves the purpose for which the personal data was collected and is no longer
necessary for legal or business purposes.</p></div>
</div>
<h3>6.<span class="indent">Where is the personal Data stored?</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>6.1.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Your personal data is stored on servers located in the country where the
Contracting Party (as defined in the Terms of use) is established. Personal data is also stored
in Sweden, where Storytel's main establishment is located. For international transfers, Storytel
applies security measures as described below in 10.5.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>7.<span class="indent">Why does Storytel process your personal data?</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>7.1.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Storytel processes Your personal data for various purposes. Primarily,
Storytel processes Your personal data in order to manage the customer relationship with You and
to fulfill its legal obligations. Your personal data may also be processed for market and
customer analysis, market research, statistics, business monitoring and business and
methodological development for Storytel in order to develop and customize the Service and its
features.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>7.2.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Storytel also processes Your personal data to provide better and more
personalized offers and services. Storytel also processes Your personal data to decrease the
risk of sending You irrelevant advertising or other types of irrelevant marketing . Personal
data may, for example, be processed, linked, segmented and analyzed in order, by means of
targeted marketing via for instance email, in app push notifications and advertising on third
party channels, to provide information, offers or recommendations on Storytel’s or its partners’
goods and services, which are tailored to Your preferences, behavior, needs or lifestyle. It may
also be used as a basis for targeted marketing towards audiences that are similar to Storytel’s
existing users. This may e.g. include processing of personal data for the purpose of creating
custom audiences on third party platforms such as Facebook and Google. Storytel may also analyze
and combine the information about You to which Storytel has access via the Service from Your
online visits or other records (e.g. Facebook or other similar social media providers) for
purposes specified in this section.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>7.3.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>In addition to the above, Storytel processes Your personal data to prevent,
detect and investigate potential prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and to
enforce our Terms (e.g. determining whether You are eligible for a Free Trial period or for any
other offer or marketing campaign as the case may be).</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>8.<span class="indent">What is the legal basis for the processing?</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>8.1.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>A majority of the personal data that Storytel processes about You are
processed because it is necessary for Storytel’s performance of the Terms, i.e. in order for
Storytel to be able to provide and administer the Service and its features. Such is the case
when Storytel processes e.g. Your contact details such as Your e-mail address or Your phone
number and information from the payment service provider.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>8.2.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Some of the personal data which Storytel processes are processed based on a
balance of interest, i.e. Storytel’s legitimate interest of processing the data outweighs the
impact and risk the processing may have on Your integrity. Such is the case when Storytel
processes Your personal data for support purposes (e.g. general support requests) or certain
 marketing purposes other than for direct marketing and when we store Your Storytel audio/ebook
(including other literary content) library information after Your subscription has ended.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>8.3.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Additionally, some personal data is processed based on Your consent. This is
the case for the processing of such personal data that Storytel gets access to via Your Facebook
account, for direct marketing of Storytel’s or Storytel’s partners’ goods and services. If You
provide personal data of other natural persons, such as Your family members, You are responsible
for seeing to that they consent to the processing of their personal data.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>8.4.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>To the extent that processing is carried out with consent as a sole legal
basis, it is voluntary for You to give such a consent and You may at any time, wholly or partly,
withdraw Your consent.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.<span class="indent">Data security and Integrity</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>9.1.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>The security, integrity and confidentiality of Your personal data is very
important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures
that are designed to protect Your personal data from in particular unauthorized access or
disclosure, use, modification, destruction and loss. From time to time, we review our security
procedures in order to assess the need to implement additional measures or to make technical
upgrades to existing procedures. Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, few security
measures are impenetrable, and we therefore kindly ask that You inform us immediately of any
suspicious activities that You notice in the Service.</p></div>

misunderstandings etc.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>10.2.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Storytel may also disclose Your personal data to third parties for the
purpose of sending You tailored advertising and marketing, for the purpose of avoiding to send
You irrelevant advertising or other types of irrelevant marketing, to measure the success and
outreach of our digital marketing and for other promotional purposes. Such is the case when
Storytel uses remarketing features and impression, interest and demographic reporting in Google
Analytics, uploads custom audiences to e.g. Facebook and Google and when we inform our business
partners, such as Facebook and Google, that a certain marketing measure generated a new specific
customer or a number of new customers as the case may be.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>10.3.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Storytel may also disclose personal data to companies that process personal
data on our behalf, such as our IT system providers, customer service companies and affiliates.
If personal data is disclosed to such companies that process data on Storytel’s behalf, Storytel
enters into data processing agreements with such parties in order to ensure that a high level of
security for Your personal data is maintained.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>10.4.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Personal data may also be disclosed, if needed, to comply with statutory
legal requirements or requirements from authorities or agencies, to safeguard Storytel’s legal
interests or to detect, prevent, or pay attention to fraud and other security or technical
issues.</p></div>

categories of recipients and for the purposes set out in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, Your personal data is transferred to the previously described
categories of recipients for the purposes set out in this privacy policy.
We will take steps to ensure that Your personal data continues to receive a standard of protection
that is at least comparable to that provided under the Personal Data Protection Act in
Singapore.</p></div>

<h3>4. <span class="indent">Content Filters</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>4.1.</div>
<div class="indent"> Any pre-installed Content filters, such as e.g. “kids’ mode” or other similar
filter functions
that may be offered from time to time, are offered to a user as an optional function. The
metadata for each title in the Content that Storytel relies on regarding e.g. age limits and
identification of literary genres is provided by Storytel’s publishing business partners.
Storytel therefore takes no responsibility for, and does not warrant that, You will find the
filters based on such metadata completely to Your personal satisfaction. Furthermore,
Storytel can not in any way guarantee that such filters are completely accurate or that they
with complete certainty have filtered all non-relevant Content in accordance with what has
been intended. If a filter does not work to Your satisfaction, please discontinue any use of
the filter immediately and let us know how we may improve the filter and the Service to
better meet Your expectations by contacting Storytel via the Storytel website. Storytel
welcomes any feedback regarding Content that You find inappropriate or unsuitable in light
of the filters used or that you otherwise suspect may contain infringing or otherwise
unlawful features. Storytel depends on Your feedback so that we may improve our filters
and our Service over time.
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>4.2.</div>
<div class="indent"> If and where a pre-installed “kids’ mode” filter is offered to You as a Subscriber
of the
Service, the settings of such filter have been made based on the metadata to allow only
such Content that is deemed by its publisher as suitable for children aged twelve (12) years
old or younger. This means that the Content made available in "Kids’ mode" may include
any and all books and genres in the Storytel content catalogue intended for kids of all ages
within this age group. Storytel can not in any way guarantee that the filter is completely
accurate or that it with complete certainty have filtered all non-relevant Content in
accordance with what has been intended.

a paying subscriber or redeem a new Storytel Gift Card. However, if You activate a Storytel
Gift Card when You are already a subscriber of the Service, Storytel will temporarily
suspend the requirement for payment of the Service until the expiry of the Gift Card, upon
which time You will be automatically transferred back as a paying customer of the Service
and resume the monthly subscription payment plan. If, in such case, the Gift Card You
activated regarded a different subscription plan than the one You were originally
subscribing to, You will automatically be transferred back to your most previously used
subscription plan. However, if such subscription plan is based on a product specific gift card
you will be automatically transferred back to your most previously used recurring
subscription plan based on a payment method not using a Gift Card.

</div>
<h3>6.<span class="indent">Where is the personal Data stored?</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>6.1.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Your personal data is stored on servers located in the country where the
Contracting Party (as defined in the Terms of use) is established. Personal data is also stored
in Sweden, where Storytel's main establishment is located. For international transfers, Storytel
applies security measures as described below in 10.5.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>7.<span class="indent">Why does Storytel process your personal data?</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>7.1.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Storytel processes Your personal data for various purposes. Primarily,
Storytel processes Your personal data in order to manage the customer relationship with You and
to fulfill its legal obligations. Your personal data may also be processed for market and
customer analysis, market research, statistics, business monitoring and business and
methodological development for Storytel in order to develop and customize the Service and its
features.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>7.2.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Storytel also processes Your personal data to provide better and more
personalized offers and services. Storytel also processes Your personal data to decrease the
risk of sending You irrelevant advertising or other types of irrelevant marketing . Personal
data may, for example, be processed, linked, segmented and analyzed in order, by means of
targeted marketing via for instance email, in app push notifications and advertising on third
party channels, to provide information, offers or recommendations on Storytel’s or its partners’
goods and services, which are tailored to Your preferences, behavior, needs or lifestyle. It may
also be used as a basis for targeted marketing towards audiences that are similar to Storytel’s
existing users. This may e.g. include processing of personal data for the purpose of creating
custom audiences on third party platforms such as Facebook and Google. Storytel may also analyze
and combine the information about You to which Storytel has access via the Service from Your
online visits or other records (e.g. Facebook or other similar social media providers) for
purposes specified in this section.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>7.3.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>In addition to the above, Storytel processes Your personal data to prevent,
detect and investigate potential prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and to
enforce our Terms (e.g. determining whether You are eligible for a Free Trial period or for any
other offer or marketing campaign as the case may be).</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>8.<span class="indent">What is the legal basis for the processing?</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>8.1.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>A majority of the personal data that Storytel processes about You are
processed because it is necessary for Storytel’s performance of the Terms, i.e. in order for
Storytel to be able to provide and administer the Service and its features. Such is the case
when Storytel processes e.g. Your contact details such as Your e-mail address or Your phone
number and information from the payment service provider.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>8.2.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Some of the personal data which Storytel processes are processed based on a
balance of interest, i.e. Storytel’s legitimate interest of processing the data outweighs the
impact and risk the processing may have on Your integrity. Such is the case when Storytel
processes Your personal data for support purposes (e.g. general support requests) or certain
marketing purposes other than for direct marketing and when we store Your Storytel audio/ebook
(including other literary content) library information after Your subscription has ended.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>8.3.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Additionally, some personal data is processed based on Your consent. This is
the case for the processing of such personal data that Storytel gets access to via Your Facebook
 account, for direct marketing of Storytel’s or Storytel’s partners’ goods and services. If You
provide personal data of other natural persons, such as Your family members, You are responsible
for seeing to that they consent to the processing of their personal data.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>8.4.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>To the extent that processing is carried out with consent as a sole legal
basis, it is voluntary for You to give such a consent and You may at any time, wholly or partly,
withdraw Your consent.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>9.<span class="indent">Data security and Integrity</span></h3>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>9.1.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>The security, integrity and confidentiality of Your personal data is very
important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures
that are designed to protect Your personal data from in particular unauthorized access or
disclosure, use, modification, destruction and loss. From time to time, we review our security
procedures in order to assess the need to implement additional measures or to make technical
upgrades to existing procedures. Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, few security
measures are impenetrable, and we therefore kindly ask that You inform us immediately of any
suspicious activities that You notice in the Service.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>10.2.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Storytel may also disclose Your personal data to third parties for the
purpose of sending You tailored advertising and marketing, for the purpose of avoiding to send
You irrelevant advertising or other types of irrelevant marketing, to measure the success and
outreach of our digital marketing and for other promotional purposes. Such is the case when
Storytel uses remarketing features and impression, interest and demographic reporting in Google
Analytics, uploads custom audiences to e.g. Facebook and Google and when we inform our business
partners, such as Facebook and Google, that a certain marketing measure generated a new specific
customer or a number of new customers as the case may be.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container-inner">
<div>10.3.</div>
<div class="indent"><p>Storytel may also disclose personal data to companies that process personal
data on our behalf, such as our IT system providers, customer service companies and affiliates.
If personal data is disclosed to such companies that process data on Storytel’s behalf, Storytel
enters into data processing agreements with such parties in order to ensure that a high level of
security for Your personal data is maintained.</p></div>
</div>
